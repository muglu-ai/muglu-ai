This is a CLI program. In this Program, we can store Employee Information like (I) Employee ID (II) Employee Name (III) Designation (IV) Department (V) Salary etc.
This whole program is written in the C language. I have implemented my Data Structure Knowledge and used Linked List to perform different operations.
While doing so, I learned how the LINKED LIST work and how we can use it to perform a different type of operation like STRINGS, DYNAMIC ALLOCATION, and many such concepts of Data Structures.
